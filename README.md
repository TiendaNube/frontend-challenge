## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and it's an example app/project that you might work at Tiendanube, we wish you can show us your skills and your knowledge on these aspects.

The project is set up with a basic architecture so you can focus into the most important features.

## What we expect on this challenge:
- Features:
  - [X] Apply an State manager to handle the basic features (Mobx, Redux, Reflux, ContextAPI - Wherether you feel confortable, we wish to understand how do you structure your logic)
  - [X] Implement an CRUD to handle **C**reate, **R**ead **U**pdate and **D**elete of the products persisting them into **Local Storage**.
  - [X] We wish you to identify component issues that are not well designed, and improve their reusability

The CRUD have to follow these requirements:
- Must persist data with refresh (Local storage as mentioned above)
- Validate and show input errors preventing submit

You can add any library into the project, but we wish to evaluate how you create your own components

Not required but desireable:
- Jest knoledge
- Any performance improvement
- Design System improvements
